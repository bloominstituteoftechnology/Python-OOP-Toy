This project will use pygame to create a variety of bouncing balls to demonstrate object-oriented programming.

Run from the root folder with python src/draw.py

Detailed Instructions:

run `pipenv install`
you will then be prompted to activate with `pipenv shell`
Then if you are in the repo root, then `python src/draw.py`

- Note -- The terminal will freeze while pygame window is running

\*Note: Pygame is known not to play well with the ESLinter. This is
actually not that unusual.
